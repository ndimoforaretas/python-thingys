## Day 13

## Debugging

- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code.
- The `Python` debugger is `pdb`.
- `pdb` is a module that is built into `Python`.
- It can be used to set breakpoints in code and step through the code line by line.
- `pdb` can be used in the terminal or in `PyCharm`.
- To use `pdb` in the terminal, use the `python3 -m pdb` command followed by the name of the file you want to debug.

### Steps in debugging

1. Reproduce the bug.
2. Find the source of the bug.
3. Fix the bug.
4. Test the fix.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until the bug is fixed.
6. Use `print()` statements to help you find the source of the bug.
